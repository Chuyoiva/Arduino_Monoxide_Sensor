# Arduino_Monoxide_Sensor
Monoxide Sensor on Arduino using MQ9 gas sensor and DTH11 sensor for temperature and humidity

This is an Android Studio App which connects to an Arduino using bluetooth and reads a connected MQ9 gas sensor and DTH11 humidity and temperature sensor.
The app contains an interface to selected the desired device, a Graph that displays the data on "real time" using MpAndroidCharts, temperature and humidity monitor view, a mapview and RecycleView that display the data obtined from Arduino and the location where the reading took place.

The app is still in development and more functions will be added to it.
